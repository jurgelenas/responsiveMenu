# jQuery.responsiveMenu

A responsive navigation jQuery plugin. It converts `<ul>` and `<ol>` menus to a select dropdowns for small screen devices. It also automatically selects the current page and adds selected="selected" for that item.

There are many other different plugins to do this job, but I couldn't find anything that suited my needs and I created my own. I discovered that I am using this plugin over and over again on my projects and I thought that It could be useful for somebody else and decided to open-source it.


### Features:

* Simple and easy to use
* Unlimited levels of submenus
* Variety of configuration options
* Works in all major desktop and mobile browsers
* Weighs only 1026 bytes minified and Gzip'ed
* Free to use under the MIT license
